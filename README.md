# Curriculum enhancement of the Parallel Computing course at Jackson State University 
## Objectives
* Getting access to HPC resources.
* Implementing/understanding effective HPC architecture
* Obtaining large datasets for data analytical problems
* Design sample projects for parallel programming using OpenMP, MPI, and OpenACC, using C++.

Target Course(s): CSC425.01 Parallel Computing 

Goal:
○ Integrating HPC with 
○ Create and refine course schedules, hands-on labs, etc.

This course (CSC 425) is for junior to senior Computer Science (CS) and Computer Engineering (CE) students. Based on the curriculum, all students should have already finished programming languages, operating systems, computer architectures, and data structure courses to develop sequential programs.  The course, will focus on implementing parallel algorithms.  The topics of the course include programming languages with libraries such as OpenMP, MPI, and OpenACC. 

The programming models consist of several subareas: 
Data parallelism
Task parallelism
Multithreaded programming
Shared memory model
Message-passing model

These projects require a large space for large data sets and computing power. As part of this effort, some of the NSF/IEEE-TCPP curriculum initiatives on Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) modules were integrated into department-wide core and elective courses offered in both fall and spring semesters. From CSC 325 Operating Systems (core), the students learn how to write simple parallel programs with the POSIX threads library.
